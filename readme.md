# KinESim
Igor Pro package and examples for simulation of homogeneous and heterogeneous electrochemical reactions

**Important:** This software requires Igor v. 8.0 to run.

Kin-E-Sim is a package for Igor Pro designed to predict the characteristic response of an analyte in various electrochemical methods, including normal pulsed voltammetry (illustrated below), cyclic voltammetry, etc. This document is intended to provide a new user the information they need to begin using the Kin-E-Sim program. See [citation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b00859) for further details on the implemented algorithms. 

## Installation
Clone the git repository and open the KES/KinESim.ipf in IgorPro.  The necessary dependencies are included and are loaded by KinESim.ipf. See [API](https://github.com/dap-biospec/KinESim/blob/master/Docs/KES_API.md#Structure) for more details of file structure. 

## Using KinESim
A [manual](https://github.com/dap-biospec/KinESim/blob/master/Docs/KES_manual.md) is provided that includes instructions for [installation](https://github.com/dap-biospec/KinESim/blob/master/Docs/KES_manual.md#Installation), a tutorial featuring [demo simulations](https://github.com/dap-biospec/KinESim/blob/master/Docs/KES_manual.md#Kin-E-Sim-Demo), and a complete description of the KinESim [control panel](https://github.com/dap-biospec/KinESim/blob/master/Docs/KES_manual.md#Control-Panel).

A demo of Kin-E-Sim containing pre-loaded simulations is available [here](https://github.com/dap-biospec/KinESim/blob/master/Demo).

An API can be found [here](https://github.com/dap-biospec/KinESim/blob/master/Docs/KES_API.md).
